    <h2>Finding your config.ini</h2>
    <p>
      The server you connect to is saved in a configuration file, and to change
      that, you need to find the file!<br /><b>Windows:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open Explorer and navigate to
        <b>C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Local\IWM</b> (AppData is a hidden folder,
        enable hidden folders!)
      </li>
      <li>Your config.ini will be there</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Linux:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your file manager</li>
      <li>
        Navigate to <b>/home/(user)/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Look through all the folders here until you find one with IWM in
        <b>pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/</b> OR search for the
        "IWM" folder
      </li>
      <li>Your config.ini file will be in threre</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h2>Changing the server (method 1)</h2>
    <p>
      Download the latest version of the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/codingMASTER398/IWM-Server-replacer/releases/tag/1.0-fix"
        >IWM server replacer</a
      >
      for your operating system.<br />Run it (if on mac or linux do so via the
      command line with ./app-name). Allow it to create a config file and give
      it the location of your config.ini file.<br />Select option 2 and enter
      <b>https://horizons.coding398.dev</b> with no slash at the end, then
      select option 3 to save and exit.<br />Close and open I Wanna Maker.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Changing the server (method 2)</h2>
    <p>
      Open config.ini with a text editor and scroll down until you see
      <b>Server_hostname</b> and <b>Server_hostname_fallback</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Replace both with exactly "https://horizons.coding398.dev", do not add a
      http:// one.
    </h3>
    <p>Close and open I Wanna Maker.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Check that it's working</h2>
    <p>
      When you enter the game, the amount of levels that show should be
      different.<br />To be sure you're connected, enter a random login into the
      prompt, and you should get a link to
      <b>https://horizons.coding398.dev/login</b>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Create an account and hop in!</h2>
    <p>
      Go to
      <a href="https://horizons.coding398.dev/login" target="_blank"
        >horizons.coding398.dev/login</a
      >
      and log-in with your Discord account.<br />You'll be given a username and
      password you can use in-game to log in!<br />Once you're in, you can start
      playing with no rules!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Cross-compatibility with the main server</h2>
    <p>
      To save you hassle, you can connect to the main server via Horizons!<br />Just
      log out and log in with the credentials to your official IWM server
      account.<br /><b
        >The proxy used will also make it look like everyone, including you, has
        admin!</b
      >
      You can get special perks with that little trick.
